This is a JDBI development tool.
When you use the `@UseClasspathSqlLocator` annotation in JDBI, the code and SQL need to be written separately, causing inconvenience in development.

By using this plugin, it helps you quickly jump from code to the corresponding SQL file.

There has one way to trigger a jump:
- Select the corresponding code, then click on "Jdbi SQL Jump" from the right-click menu.
